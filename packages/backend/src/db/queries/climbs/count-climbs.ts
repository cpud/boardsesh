 * Counts the total number of climbs matching the search criteria.
 * This is a separate query from searchClimbs to avoid the expensive count(*) over()
 * window function that forces a full table scan.
 *
 * This query is only executed when the `totalCount` field is requested in the GraphQL query.
 * The ClimbSearchResult type uses field-level resolvers, so if a client only requests
 * `climbs` and `hasMore`, this count query is never executed - improving performance.
 *
 * @see resolvers.ts ClimbSearchResult.totalCount for the field resolver
