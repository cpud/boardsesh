/**
 * Aliased board_difficulty_grades table for consensus grade lookups.
 * Resolves the community-voted grade from boardClimbStats.displayDifficulty
 * without a correlated subquery.
 *
 * ## Required joins (in order)
 *
 * Queries that use any of the expressions below must include these joins:
 *
 * 1. `boardClimbStats` — joined on (climbUuid, boardType, angle)
 * 2. `boardDifficultyGrades` — joined on (tick.difficulty, boardType) — user's logged grade
 * 3. `consensusGradeTable` — joined via `consensusGradeJoinCondition` — consensus grade
 *
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * db.select({ difficultyName: difficultyNameWithFallbackExpr })
 *   .from(boardseshTicks)
 *   .leftJoin(boardClimbStats, ...)
 *   .leftJoin(boardDifficultyGrades, ...)
 *   .leftJoin(consensusGradeTable, consensusGradeJoinCondition)
 * ```
 *
 * If a required join is missing the query will produce nulls (not an error)
 * because these are LEFT JOINs with nullable column references.
