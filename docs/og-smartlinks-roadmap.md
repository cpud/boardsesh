## OG Image API Routes

| `/api/og/setter` | username | Avatar + name + ascents-per-grade bar chart for created climbs |

## Future Improvements

### Custom OG Images for Static Pages

These pages currently use the default brand OG image. Custom images could improve click-through:

- `/aurora-migration` - Could show a visual comparison or migration flow
- `/about` - Could show board photos or app screenshots

### Board List Page OG

The `/b/[board_slug]/[angle]/list` page could potentially have a custom OG image showing a sample of popular climbs on that board, but the value is low since these pages are primarily navigational.

### Sitemap Updates

When adding new public page types, update `packages/web/app/sitemap.ts` to include:
- Popular setter profiles
- Popular climb view URLs (slug-based)
- Public playlists

### Structured Data

Consider adding JSON-LD structured data to:
- Profile pages (`ProfilePage` type)
- Session pages (event-like structured data)
- Homepage (`Organization` + `WebSite` types)
