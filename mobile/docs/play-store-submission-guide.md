# Google Play Store Submission Guide

Step-by-step instructions for submitting Boardsesh to the Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites

- Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee) - https://play.google.com/console/signup
- Android Studio (for local builds, emulator testing, and debugging)
- Java 21 (Temurin) - `brew install --cask temurin@21` on macOS or install from https://adoptium.net
- Bundle/package name: `com.boardsesh.app`

### Upload Keystore

You need a keystore to sign release builds. If one does not already exist, generate it:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v \
  -keystore release.keystore \
  -alias boardsesh \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -storepass YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD \
  -keypass YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD \
  -dname "CN=Boardsesh, O=Boardsesh, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=US"
```

Store this keystore file securely. You cannot change the upload key after your first Play Store upload without contacting Google support. For CI, the keystore is base64-encoded and stored as a GitHub Actions secret (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`).

---

## 1. Generate Assets (App Icon, Splash Screen)

From the repo root:

```bash
cd mobile
bun run generate-assets
```

This generates all required icon sizes and splash screen assets from the source images in `mobile/resources/`. The output goes into `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/` (mipmap and drawable directories).

Verify the generated assets look correct before proceeding.

---

## 2. Take Screenshots

Automated approach using Playwright:

```bash
cd packages/web
bunx playwright test e2e/app-store-screenshots.spec.ts
```

Screenshots are saved to `mobile/screenshots/`.

### Required screenshot specs

| Device type | Dimensions                                   | Required?          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Phone       | 16:9 or 9:16, min 320px, max 3840px per side | Yes (min 2, max 8) |
| 7" Tablet   | 16:9 or 9:16                                 | Recommended        |
| 10" Tablet  | 16:9 or 9:16                                 | Optional           |

### Manual alternative using Android Studio emulator

1. Open Android Studio > Device Manager > Create Virtual Device.
2. Select **Pixel 8 Pro** (or similar recent phone profile).
3. Download and select an API 36 system image.
4. Start the emulator and run the app.
5. Navigate to each key screen:
   - Board selection / home
   - Climb list with search results
   - Climb detail with hold overlay on board image
   - Queue panel with multiple climbs
   - Bluetooth connection / scanning screen
   - Party Mode session view
   - Logbook / profile stats
6. Click the camera icon in the emulator toolbar to capture screenshots.

### Screenshot tips

- Use the demo account (test@boardsesh.com / test) so there is real data in the logbook.
- Show a variety of boards (Kilter and Tension at minimum).
- Make sure the queue has 3-5 climbs to show the feature clearly.
- For the Bluetooth screenshot, show the scanning/pairing UI (it does not need a connected board).

## 3. Build AAB (Android App Bundle)

The Play Store requires AAB format, not APK. (APKs are fine for sideloading and testing, but Play Store submissions must use AAB.)

### Local build

The signing config in `build.gradle` reads credentials from environment variables:

```bash
cd mobile
bunx cap sync android
cd android

ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH=/path/to/release.keystore \
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=yourpass \
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=boardsesh \
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=yourkeypass \
./gradlew bundleRelease --stacktrace
```

Output: `mobile/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### CI build

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/android-release.yml`) builds both a signed APK and AAB on every push to `main` that touches `mobile/`. If the `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret is configured, it also uploads the AAB to the Google Play internal testing track automatically.

### Increment version code

Before each Play Store upload, increment `versionCode` in `mobile/android/app/build.gradle`. The CI workflow does this automatically using the GitHub Actions run number. For local builds, edit the value manually:

```groovy
versionCode = 2  // Must be higher than previous upload
versionName = "1.0.1"
```

---

## 8. Target Audience and Content

Go to **Policy > App content > Target audience and content**.

- Target age group: **18 and over** (select the highest age bracket to avoid any children's policy requirements)
- The app is not designed for or directed at children under 13
- Do NOT opt into the Google Play Families program
- No ads in the app

---

## 9. App Signing

Google Play App Signing is mandatory for new apps. Here is how it works:

1. **Google holds the app signing key.** Google generates and manages the key used to sign the APK that users download from the Play Store.
2. **You sign with your upload key.** You sign the AAB with the keystore from the Prerequisites section. Google verifies this signature, strips it, and re-signs with their key.
3. **You cannot bypass this.** It is enabled automatically for new apps.

### After your first upload

Go to **Setup > App signing** in Play Console. You will see two certificates:

- **App signing key certificate** - Google's key, used to sign distributed APKs
- **Upload key certificate** - Your key, used to verify your uploads

Copy the **SHA-256 fingerprint** of the app signing key certificate. You need this for deep linking.

### Get your upload key fingerprint

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore release.keystore -alias your-alias
```

Look for the `SHA256:` line in the Certificate fingerprints section.

### Configure deep linking (assetlinks.json)

For Android App Links (`/join/*` deep links) to work, the `assetlinks.json` file served at `https://www.boardsesh.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json` must contain the SHA-256 fingerprints of both your upload key AND Google's app signing key.

The dynamic route at `packages/web/app/.well-known/assetlinks.json/route.ts` reads fingerprints from the `ANDROID_APP_LINK_CERT_FINGERPRINTS` environment variable on Vercel. Set this to a comma-separated list of SHA-256 fingerprints:

```
ANDROID_APP_LINK_CERT_FINGERPRINTS=AA:BB:CC:...(upload key),DD:EE:FF:...(google signing key)
```

Both fingerprints should be included. The upload key fingerprint is needed during development/sideloading. The Google signing key fingerprint is needed for Play Store installs.

## 10. Release Tracks

Google Play has four release tracks, in order of progression:

| Track            | Audience                                             | Review required? | Notes                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Internal testing | Up to 100 testers you invite by email                | No               | Builds are available within minutes. Start here. |
| Closed testing   | Invite-only testers via email lists or Google Groups | Yes              | Useful for wider beta testing.                   |
| Open testing     | Anyone can join from the Play Store listing          | Yes              | Public opt-in beta.                              |
| Production       | Everyone on Play Store                               | Yes              | Full public release.                             |

**Recommended path:** Upload to Internal testing first to verify the app installs and runs correctly on real devices. If everything works, go directly to Production. You do not need to use Closed or Open testing unless you want a broader beta period.

To set up Internal testing:

1. Go to **Testing > Internal testing**.
2. Click **Create new release**.
3. Upload your AAB.
4. Add release notes.
5. Click **Review release** then **Start rollout to internal testing**.
6. Go to the **Testers** tab and add tester email addresses.
7. Share the opt-in link with your testers.

---

## 11. Submit for Review (Production)

1. Go to **Production** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create new release**.
3. Upload the AAB file.
4. Fill in the **Release notes** (What's New). Use the text from `mobile/metadata/play-store-metadata.md`.
5. Click **Review release**. Google will show warnings if any setup checklist items are incomplete.
6. Fix any issues flagged (missing screenshots, incomplete data safety form, etc.).
7. Click **Start rollout to production**.

Google runs a **pre-launch report** automatically using Firebase Test Lab. Check it under **Quality > Pre-launch report** after uploading. This tests your app on a range of real devices and flags crashes, performance issues, and accessibility problems.

### Review timeline

Google reviews typically take **a few hours to a few days**. Faster than Apple in most cases. First submissions may take longer. You will get an email when the review is complete.

## 12. Common Rejection Reasons

### WebView-Based App Policy

Google may flag apps that are primarily WebView wrappers. The defense for Boardsesh:

- The app uses native Android Bluetooth APIs (via the `@capacitor-community/bluetooth-le` Capacitor plugin) to communicate with climbing board hardware over BLE.
- While Web Bluetooth does work in Chrome on Android, the native BLE plugin provides: better connection reliability, persistent connections that survive screen-off, no Chrome permission dialogs, background BLE support so the board stays lit while the user climbs, and native app lifecycle management.
- The app also provides native deep link handling (`/join/*` Android App Links) and a native splash screen.
- If questioned, respond with: "The app uses native Android BLE APIs to scan for climbing boards advertising the Aurora service (UUID 4488b571-7806-4df6-bcff-a2897e4953ff) and writes LED lighting commands to the Nordic UART RX characteristic (UUID 6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e). The native BLE layer provides persistent connections, background support, and better reliability than Web Bluetooth. The app also handles Android App Links natively for session deep linking."

### Device and Feature Targeting

The app requires BLE but does not currently declare `<uses-feature>` for it in `AndroidManifest.xml`. Consider adding:

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="true" />
```

This filters the Play Store listing so devices without BLE hardware cannot install the app, preventing bad reviews from users on unsupported devices.

### Permissions

Google may ask why the app requests location permissions alongside Bluetooth. The answer:

- On Android 12+ (API 31+), `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` with `android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"` can avoid location permission for BLE scanning alone.
- However, Boardsesh also uses location for **Party Mode session discovery** (finding nearby climbing sessions). Location permission is legitimately needed for that feature, independent of Bluetooth.
- Both `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` are declared because Party Mode benefits from precise location for proximity-based session matching.

### App Access

If the app requires sign-in, Google may ask for test credentials during review. Provide:

- Email: test@boardsesh.com
- Password: test

Add these in **Policy > App content > App access** if Google flags the app as restricted.

---

## 13. Post-Submission

### Monitor the pre-launch report

After uploading, check **Quality > Pre-launch report** for crashes, ANRs, and performance issues found during automated testing on Firebase Test Lab devices.

### After approval

- The app appears on the Play Store. If you used staged rollout, it starts at your chosen percentage.
- Use **staged rollouts** for updates: start at 10%, check crash rates, then increase to 50% and then 100%.
- Monitor ratings and reviews in Play Console. Respond to user reviews directly from the console.
- Update the "What's New" text for each new version.
- Subsequent updates follow the same build, upload, submit flow. Version code must increment with each upload.

### If rejected

1. Read the rejection email carefully. Google cites specific policy violations.
2. Fix the issue.
3. Build a new AAB with an incremented `versionCode`.
4. Upload and resubmit. If you believe the rejection was incorrect, use the appeal form in Play Console with a clear explanation of why the app complies.

## 14. CI/CD Secrets

The GitHub Actions workflow requires these repository secrets for automated builds and Play Store uploads:

| Secret                             | Description                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`          | Base64-encoded upload keystore file (`base64 -w0 release.keystore`) |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`        | Keystore password                                                   |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`                | Key alias (e.g., `boardsesh`)                                       |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`             | Key password                                                        |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Google Play API service account JSON for automated uploads          |

### Create the Google Play service account

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console** > **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
2. Create a service account (e.g., `play-store-upload@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
3. Create a JSON key for the service account and download it.
4. Go to **Google Play Console** > **Settings** > **API access**.
5. Link your Google Cloud project if not already linked.
6. Find the service account and click **Manage Play Console permissions**.
7. Grant the **Release to production, exclude devices, and use Play App Signing** permission (or **Release manager** for broader access).
8. Add the full JSON key content as the `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret in your GitHub repository settings.

The workflow uploads to the **internal testing** track by default. To upload to production directly, change `track: internal` to `track: production` in the workflow file.
